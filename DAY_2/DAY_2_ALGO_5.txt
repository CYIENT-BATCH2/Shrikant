1. Take that number is Encoded in message in run time.
2. Find the number is less than 9, Take the loop for that.
3. IF less than 9 take set a each number has a perticuler charcter which is encoded in message.
4. If it contain space then increated number.
5. If that number more than 9 that will take another loop for that.
6. Also set that each number having a perticular charcter.
7.using that logic print that number is converted in charcter
