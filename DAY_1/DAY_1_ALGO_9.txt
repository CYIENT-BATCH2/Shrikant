1. If we print the truth table of AND & OR & NOT,So we ask for the user which truth table they want.
2. user gives input which truth table want.
3. Created that perticular function for the truth table,so user input directly goes to that function.
4. In that function initi. the variables as like truth table input, like Input X and Input Y.
5. In AND Operation if 2 inputs like 1 1 given then output is 1 another are 0.
   Using Logical AND we get that condition true or false.
   Assinging that true or false to variables.
   Print That all variables to get Output.
6. In OR operation if 2 Inputs like 0 0 then output will be 0 other are 1.
   Using Logical AND we get that condition true or false.
   Print That all variables to get Output.
7. In Not operation in if it is zero then it converts into 1 nd vice versa.
   Using the Equality Operation conpare that it is 0 or 1.
   Print That all variables to get Output.
