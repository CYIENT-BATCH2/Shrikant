1. User will decide that what he find for him choice, that input gives back the operation output.
2. If user choose the Hexadecimal to Binery then control goes to that function and doing that operation like
   again ask for that values in hexadcimal for printing binery of that number shifting the bit towards right side
   and doing and operation, prinf the loop in format specifier %d, get user output.
3. same as Others process when user gives input in binery number that it converted into hexadecimal, taking each bit
   adding and then multiply that constant number as 2.
4. For hexadecimal to decimal right shift the number bit by bit after than doing operation with and
   Printing in %d to get decimal values.
5. For printing binery of that number shifting the bit towards right side and doing and operation,
   prinf the loop in format specifier %d, get user output.
6. user have a choice to what he wants
